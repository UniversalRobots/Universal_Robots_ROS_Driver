# This action is for setting the robot into a desired mode (e.g. RUNNING) and safety mode into a
# non-critical state (e.g. NORMAL or REDUCED), for example after a safety incident happened.

# goal
ur_dashboard_msgs/RobotMode target_robot_mode

# Stop program execution before restoring the target mode. Can be used together with 'play_program'.
bool stop_program

# Play the currently loaded program after target mode is reached.#
# NOTE: Requesting mode RUNNING in combination with this will make the robot continue the motion it
# was doing before. This might probably lead into the same problem (protective stop, EM-Stop due to
# faulty motion, etc.) If you want to be safe, set the 'stop_program' flag below and manually play
# the program after robot state is returned to normal.
# This flag will only be used when requesting mode RUNNING
